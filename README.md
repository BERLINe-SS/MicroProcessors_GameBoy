Game Boy Microprocessor Project
A project exploring the microprocessor architecture of the Nintendo Game Boy, including hardware programming, emulation, or assembly-level development.

📌 Overview
This repository contains code and documentation related to:

Game Boy (DMG) hardware programming

LR35902 (Z80-like) microprocessor studies

Assembly language examples for Game Boy

Possibly an emulator or hardware interaction project

🚀 Features
✔️ Game Boy CPU (LR35902) emulation (if applicable)
✔️ Assembly programming examples
✔️ Hardware interaction (e.g., GPIO, memory mapping)
✔️ Educational material on Game Boy architecture

🛠️ Setup & Usage
Prerequisites
A Game Boy emulator (e.g., BGB, SameBoy)

Assembler (e.g., RGBDS)

(If emulator-related) C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang)
